# PPOP-report

Report generator for PPOP-funds project. I used my personal bank account to gather donations, so I needed a way to differentiate my transactions (and deposits to cover them) from fund.

## How to run

Put your settings into `config/dev.exs` and run `mix escript.build && ./ppop_report`.
